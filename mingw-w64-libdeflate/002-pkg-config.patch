 Description: Fast implementation of DEFLATE, zlib, and gzip
 Version: @PROJECT_VERSION@
 Libs: -L${libdir} -ldeflate
-Cflags: -I${includedir}

-# Note: this library's public header allows LIBDEFLATE_DLL to be defined when
-# linking to the DLL on Windows, to make __declspec(dllimport) be used.
-# However, the only way to define a shared-library-only flag in a pkgconfig file
-# is to use the weird workaround of unconditionally defining it in Cflags, then
-# undefining it in Cflags.private.  Just don't bother with this, since
-# __declspec(dllimport) is optional anyway.  It is a very minor performance
-# optimization that is irrelevant for most use cases of libdeflate.
