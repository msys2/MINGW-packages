Problems that are not from doing the very simple tests in
package-testing.txt maybe upsteam problems.

The UCRT64 and MINGW64 packages builds things in a way not supported by
the Julia Team; therefore, do not report UCRT64/MINGW64 problems upstream.
And problems and issues should be checked for at
https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues.

The open issue https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/48081 resulted
in this package copying libmsvcrt.a to work around that issue.
