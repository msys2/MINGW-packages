Subject: [PATCH] [libcxx][libcxxabi] guess Win32 visibility disable

On Win32, when building a static library, it is important to not
override an end developer's visibility annotations. In libc++abi
there is a check and a -D that to disable overrides while libc++
stores this information in __config_site. Each requires that the
other's information is accurate (if libc++abi thinks libc++ will
be shared then it fails to define vtables; if libc++ thinks that
libc++abi will be shared, it incorrectly imports __cxa_exception
functions); we thereby (clumsily) attempt to guess their status.
