Subject: [PATCH 03/15] Windows: Use '/' not '\' in progpath and leave case
 as-is

Windows can handle both '/' and '\' dirseps. GCC will
have been built using Cygwin, MSYS* or cross-compiled
from a system where dirsep is '/' so it is cleaner to
force the dirseps to be '/' and keep the case as-is.

This way, the value will be consistent with the build
system and string operations, be they internal to GCC
or external to it (e.g. processing map files with sed)
have a better chance of working as expected.

A concrete instance of when this matters is when cross
compiling GNU/Linux glibc on Windows.
