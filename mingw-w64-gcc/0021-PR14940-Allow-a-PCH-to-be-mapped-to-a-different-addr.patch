Subject: [PATCH] [PR14940] Allow a PCH to be mapped to a different address

First, try mapping the PCH to its original address. If that fails, try
letting the system choose one; the PCH can be relocated thereafter.

	PR pch/14940
	* config/i386/host-mingw32.cc (mingw32_gt_pch_use_address):
	Replace the loop that attempted to map the PCH only to its
	original address with more adaptive operations
