Subject: [PATCH 120/N] posixmodule: undefine `HAVE_OPENDIR`

opendir is detected by configure on mingw-w64, and for some reason
things don't work as expected. For example, os.listdir always returns
the cwd's directory listing instead of the one specified. By
un-defining, this, os.listdir will use the one which uses native
windows API.
