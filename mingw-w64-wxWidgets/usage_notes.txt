Suggested usage notes:

Add "${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-wxmsw3.2" to depends.
And in some/most cases, add "${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-wxWidgets3.2"
to makedepends. In very rare cases, it might be necessary to add 
"${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-bakefile3.2" to makedepends. When building
Code::Blocks, the adding of "${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-msw_cb_headers3.2"
to makedepends is needed.
