Suggested usage notes:

${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-libwxgtk3.2-gtk3 installs the wxGTK DLLs. And,
when creating an MinGW package, this package should be added to depends,
unless the package only needs static wxGTK libraries.

${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-libwxgtk3.2-gtk3-dev installs the wxGTK packages
normally needed to build an wxGTK project. And, when creating an MinGW
package, this package should be added to makedepends. This package
installs wx-config-3.2 and wxrc-3.2 which is normally enough for
building projects.

${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-libwxgtk3.2-gtk3-wxconfig installs the wxGTK
configuration scripts wx-config and wx-config-static. If these scripts
are needed, install this package. And, when creating an MinGW package,
this package may need to be added to makedepends.

${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-wx3.2-common installs the bakefiles presets,
wxwin.m4, and wxrc.exe files. If these files are needed, install this
package. And, when creating an MinGW package, this package may need to
be added to makedepends.
