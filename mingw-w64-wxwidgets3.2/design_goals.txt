Primary design goal allow wxMSW 3.0 DLL applications, 
wxMSW 3.2 DLL applications, and wxGTK 3.2 DLL applications to be
installed at the same time.

Secondary design goal allow wxWidgets 3.0 applications and 
wxWidgets 3.2 applications to be developed at the same time. Note, it
will not be possible to develop wxGTK and wxMSW at the same time. The
makedepends of wxGTK 3.2 and wxMSW 3.2 will conflict.
