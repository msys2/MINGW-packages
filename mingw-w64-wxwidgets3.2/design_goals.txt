Primary design goal allow wxMSW 3.0 DLL applications, 
wxMSW 3.2 DLL applications, and wxGTK 3.2 DLL applications to be
installed at the same time.

Secondary design goal allow wxWidgets 3.0 applications and 
wxWidgets 3.2 applications to be developed at the same time.

Decided that Arch-Linux way of renaming wx-config will help to do
something like the second goal. Should be able to work on wxMSW 3.2 and
wxGTK 3.2 at the same time.
